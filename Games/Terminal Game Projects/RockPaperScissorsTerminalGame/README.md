<h1>Rock Paper Scissors (Terminal Version)</h1>

This is a build in Microsoft Visual Studio. You would need to open this solution through there although I did compile it. Just basic functionality for a standard Rock Paper Scissors Game. Only has conditions and loops for the most part, was gonna add an enumeration, but had a quick Error Handling message to solve the issue quickly. Enjoy!
