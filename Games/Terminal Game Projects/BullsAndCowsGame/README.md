<h1>Bulls & Cows</h1>

This project was built with me following a Udemy Course. This demonstrates pure C++ with writing classes, enumerations, structs, methods, functions, conditions and loops to write a isogram guessing game. 

This project was also built in Microsoft Visual Studio, a first for me in Games since I have been writing basically in VS Code for the most part.
