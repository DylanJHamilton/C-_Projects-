<h1>ESCAPE Version 1.1</h1><br />


<b>This is Escape.</b> Kind of thought this out from scratch. I am writing some newer apps rather from console or from Unreal or Unity. You are kidnapped by someone and with the help of hints of the sum and product of a number combination from a Police Officer, you may be able to make it out alive. The point is to just add the combination. If you do not solve the problem, your kidnapper will "get you" and it is Game Over.

Simply download the CLANG compiler for your operating system. Open this up in VS Code or in your Command Prompt or Terminal and then just play away. 

This just demonstrates basic knowledge of the C++ language and basic modulus. I will be continuing to add on to this C++ project such as a timing functionality etc. 

<b>UPDATES:</b>
1. Added a Replay Functionality. (1.1)
2. Added some Art on the Start Game Message. (1.1)
3. Added Another Dialogue before another level starts. (1.1)
